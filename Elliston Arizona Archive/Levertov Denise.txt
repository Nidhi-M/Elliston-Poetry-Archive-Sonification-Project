The Day the Audience Walked Out on Me, and Why.
Like this it happened: after the antiphonal reading from the psalms and the dance of lamentation before The altar, and the two poems, Life at War and What Were They Like, I began my rap, and said: 
Yes, it is well that we have gathered in this chapel to remember the students shot at Kent State, 
but let us be sure we know our gathering is a mockery unless we remember also the black students shot at Orangeburg two years Fred. Hampton murdered in his bed by the police only months ago. 
And while I spoke the people - girls, older women, a few men - began to rise and turn their backs to the altar and leave. 
And I went on and said, Yes, it is well that we remember all of these, but let us be sure we know it is hypocrisy to think of them unless we make our actions their memorial, actions of militant resistance. 
By then the pews were almost emptY and I returned to my seat and a man stood uP in the back of the quiet chapel (near the wide-open doors through which the green of May Showed and the long shadows of late afternoon)
and said my words desecrated a holy place.
And a few days later when some more students (black) were shot qat Jackson Mississippi. no one desecrated the white folks' chapel because no memorial service was held
