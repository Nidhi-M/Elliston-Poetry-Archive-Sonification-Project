My Son, My Executioner
My son, my executioner, 
       I take you in my arms, 
Quiet and small and just astir 
And whom my body warms.

Sweet death, small son, our instrument 
      Of immortality, 
Your cries and hunger document 
Our bodily decay.

We twenty-five and twenty-two 
      Who seemed to live forever 
Observe enduring life in you 
And start to die together.
