IN A DREAM 
a vacuum cleaner held over my head is drawing out my brains through my nostrils, blood running in a column straight up into the vacuum bag whining like a jet engine. I feel my intestines too beginning to move up through my gullet and soon they will be pouring through my nose. My bones quiver in their sockets, my knees are shaking. I sit down, emptiness is becoming me. I can no longer think, I just listen to the sucking vacuum. Here goes my heart, straight up into my throat and choking me, pumping in my throat. It is filling my mouth, it is forcing its way between my teeth. The vacuum roars and my mouth flies open and my heart is gone. How is it I keep writing? The vacuum roars and whines alternately, my ears stick to my head but now my head is rising, a wind is whistling through my skull. My head is being lifted from my neck. Take me altogether, great vacuum: my arms, legs, sex, shoes, clothes, my pen gripped in my whitened hand drained of blood. Take me altogether and I triumph, whirled in the vacuum bag with my satellite heart, brain, bones and blood.
