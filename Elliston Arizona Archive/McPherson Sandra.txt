HIS BODY 
He doesn't like it, of course—others, who don't wear it but see it, do. He's pale, like a big desert, but you can find flowers. No, not entirely pale: between shin and ankle the twin sun marks; and where his shirt (now draped from a chair back) was, he contrasts with dark hands and neck/face like a rained-on street where a car has just been driven away. Don't picture a beer paunch. And he is a smooth animal, or soft where he isn't smooth, down to his toadskin testicles. He lies prone on clean bedsheets. There is a single light in the room. Now run your hand down his back, its small, and , the hi, and over. Their sheen's like that on blue metal music boxes made to hold powder. But the rest of him is sprouted with black down-going hair, his whiskers in so many foxholes, eager to out. Are they in any order? Age has so far remained locked inside. I'm not a doctor and glad not to have a doctor's viewpoint. I'm glad I haven't the petite, overwhelmed sight of an antibody. 
And yet I'm not just anybody perusing his body— I have a reason to like it better than like other bodies. Someone else can praise those, each lonely and earthly, wanting to be celestial.
